- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MathewsCustoms

  I am curently working on a Kali lab designed to be a pocket hack lab on a Raspbery Pi 0w it is running a web server and a WiFi Hotspot. You can run terminal commands from a web page that you can access from your phone.
  I am still in the building phase but i will soon have a step by step guide posted and an image that can be used that has everything needed already in place.

  I enjoy writting codes in many different languages from C and PHP to Java and Python. I also enjoy playing with automation and scripting from BASH to PowerShell. If you have a project you would like help on let me know, I'm always open to learn something new.
If you would like to reach out to me send me an email at admin@mathewscustoms.com
